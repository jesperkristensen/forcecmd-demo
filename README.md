[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jesperkristensen/forcecmd-demo.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/jesperkristensen/forcecmd-demo)

This branch is an example of how to set up [forcecmd](https://github.com/jesperkristensen/forcecmd) to back up all your Salesforce organization's metadata completely in the cloud using GitHub and Travis CI. All Salesforce metadata is automatically downloaded on a regular schedule and committed to Git. This branch contains the Travis CI backup script. The [master](https://github.com/jesperkristensen/forcecmd-demo/tree/master) branch contains the backed up metadata.
